/***
  This file is a placeholder for the Event_manager class you will write 
  in phase 7 (p7).

  My class Window uses class Event_manager.  Since p6 uses class Window
  you need this placeholder class to get p6 to work.

  You may use this file and event_manager.cpp w/o modification in p6.

  You may use them as a starting point for your Event_manager class for p7.

  I have put in just enough for it to work in p6.
